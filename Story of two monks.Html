					<p class="sen1" onautocomplete="play audio"> Once upon a time a senior monk and a junior monk were traveling together.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
					<p class="sen2"> At one point, they came to a river with a strong current.</p> 
						<br>
						<br>
					 <p class="sen3"> As the monks were preparing to cross the river, they saw a very young and beautiful woman also attempting to cross.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
					<p class="sen4"> The young woman asked if they could help her cross to the other side.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
					<p class="sen5"> The two monks glanced at one another because they had taken vows not to touch a woman.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
					<p class="sen6">Then, without a word, the older monk picked up the woman, carried her across the river, placed her gently on the other side, and carried on his journey.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
					<p class="sen7">The younger monk couldn’t believe what had just happened.</p> 
						<br>
						<br>
					<p class="sen8">After rejoining his companion, he was speechless, and an hour passed without a word between them.</p>
						<br>
						<br>
					<p class="sen9">Two more hours passed, then three, finally the younger monk could contain himself any longer, and blurted out “As monks, we are not permitted a woman, how could you then carry that woman on your shoulders?”</p>
						<br>
						<br>
					<p class="sen10">The older monk looked at him and replied, “Brother, I set her down on the other side of the river, why are you still carrying her?” </p>
